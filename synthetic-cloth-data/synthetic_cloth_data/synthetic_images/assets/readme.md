# Blender Asset setup

## PolyHaven

## Google Scanned Objects
- run the download script to download the assets to the desired location.
- run the script to import the GSOs to blender
- save the blender file with all the assets into the directory where you downloaded the GSOs
- Add an Asset Library to blender (preferences > file paths) that points to the directory of the GSO and name it`Google Scanned Objects`
- save and you are done 

## Snapshots
- run the `make_assets_snapshots.py` file to obtain a json for each asset library. The main purpose is to enable reproducibility, both over time on the same machine and for different users/machines.
